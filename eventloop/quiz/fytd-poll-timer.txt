- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
First running the setTimeout and someAsyncOperation
when the file read is complete, the callback will be called
the timer has less prioity, therefore its in the queue
someAsyncOperation get lock 
then the event loop begin and in the call stage

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
 event loop does not change, but the timing does
 setTimeout callback will still execute after its 100ms delay, but before the someAsyncOperation callback finishes its new 150s delay

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
It will be placed in the queue of the event loop and will execute once the call stack is clear and after any currently executing script.
setTimeout is scheduled to run as soon as possible in the event loop
